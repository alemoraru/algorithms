# Algorithms

A quick overview of essential algorithms for any coding contest and c++ language tutorials. Moreover, some algorithms might be 
only in c++, only in java, or in both. For the most part, I will try to have everything in both languages.
A quick overview of essential algorithms for any coding contest and c++ language tutorials. 
This is a quick .md summary of the information you can already find at http://cp-algorithms.com/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/.

In this repository you will find different essential algorithms for topics such as : 
* Algebra
* Graph Theory
* String manipulation

Also, besides cp-algorithms, this repository includes essentials of other basic c/c++ constructs and features,
most notably : 
* Classes
* Pointers & References
* Structs

The repository is therefore split into two parts, nameley :
* Subfolder [algos](algos), which contains relevant cp* algorithms
* Subfolder [tutorials](tutorials), which contains tutorials to c/c++ syntax and constructs
for a better use of the language.

**NOTES:**
* This is a WIP repository, therefore not all mentioned information is complete and/or present.
* For any questions, feel free to contact me. 

*cp - competitive programming (fancy word of saying algorithm)
