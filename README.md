# Algorithms
A quick overview of essential algorithms for any coding contest and c++ language tutorials*. 
This is a quick .md summary of the information you can already find at http://cp-algorithms.com/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/.

In this repository you will find different essential algorithms for topics such as : 
* Algebra
* Graph Theory
* String manipulation

Also, besides cp-algorithms, this repository includes essentials of other basic c/c++ constructs and features,
most notably : 
* Classes
* Pointers & References
* Structs

The repository is therefore split into two parts, nameley :
* Subfolder "__algos__", which contains relevant c++ algorithms
* Subfolder "__tutorials__", which contains tutorials to c/c++ syntax and constructs
for a better use of the language.

**NOTE**: This is a WIP repository, therefore not all mentioned information is complete and/or present.

* Java is also present in this repository, however, equivalent c++ code is found as well.
