# Description 
A quick overview of essential algorithms for any coding contest and c++ language tutorials. Moreover, some algorithms might be 
only in c++, only in java, or in both. For the most part, I will try to have everything in both languages.

This is a quick .md summary of the information gathered in university and also information you can already find at [cp-algorithms](http://cp-algorithms.com/) and [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), while also having some information gathered from the **Algorithm Design** book by _Jon Kleinberg_ and _Ã‰va Tardos_ . The purpose of this repository is to have a smoother experience when learning algorithms & data structures. Bear in mind, however, that this repository follows the structure that I believe to be efficient, therefore it might not be applicable to you as well. 

# Structure 
In this repository you will find different essential algorithms for topics such as : 
* Algebra
* Graph theory
* Sorting algorithms
* Divide & conquer algorithms
* Dynamic programming
* Greedy algorithms
* & more on the way

Also, besides cp-algorithms, this repository includes essentials of other basic c/c++ constructs and features,
most notably : 
* Classes
* Pointers & References
* Structs

The repository is therefore split into two parts, nameley :
* Subfolder [algos](algos/ALGOS-MENU.md), which contains relevant cp* algorithms
* Subfolder [tutorials](tutorials/TUTORIALS-MENU.md), which contains tutorials to c/c++ syntax and constructs
for a better use of the language.

# Notes

* This is a WIP repository, therefore not all mentioned information is complete and/or present.
* As for the tutorials folder, I will update it as soon as possible with a good structure and more significant content. 
* If you feel like you have found a mistake or something that ambiguous, please let me know.
* For any another questions, feel free to contact me.

*cp - competitive programming (fancy word of saying algorithm)
